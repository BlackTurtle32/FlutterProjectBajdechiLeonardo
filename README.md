Hello there!

This project runs correctly using a custom backend:

1. MongoDB NoSQL Database (MongoDB Compass) with a local server installed
2. ASP.NET Core Web API (C#)

Steps to set up this application locally:

1. Install Visual Studio (.NET 7/8) to run the ASP .NET Core Web APIs (Backend).
2. Install MongoDB Compass and a local instance of the MongoDB Server.
3. Install Android Studio SDK and an Android Emulator (optional) â€“ the app is designed to run in the browser as well.
4. Install Flutter/Dart.
5. Open the API solutions in Visual Studio and run them using the HTTP option in the Run tab. If Swagger is loaded in your browser, then the API is online.
6. Run the main.dart file.

Note: There are two files where the API endpoints are stored, one for Android Emulator calls and one for browser calls. Depending on the intended testing/viewing platform, update the relevant code.

Repository Contents:

This repository contains only the Flutter/Dart part of the project, specifically the frontend.

I hope everything is in place, and if there is anything else needed, please let me know.

Thank you! :)
